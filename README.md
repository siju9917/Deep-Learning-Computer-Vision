# Deep-Learning-Computer-Vision
Application and Implementations of Keras &amp; TensorFlow (from APPM 5720)


Implementations using TensorFlow based on mathematical theory taught in APPM 5720: Applied Deep Learning- Computer Vision.

Each folder contains its own README explaining in more detail what the TensorFlow implementation of the report in about. 


Many of these reports were developed in conjuction with my classmate and peer-graduate researcher in Hodge Lab: Jackson Curry [@jacksonCurry6464](https://github.com/jacksonCurry6464)
