In this first report, I will be learning how to implement the mathematical concepts we've been learning in class using TensorFlow (the first ML package I have used) from a few resources and a recommended youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhhyoLH6IjfxVOdVC1P1L5z5azs0XjMsb). This will begin with basic TF operations, then building some basic nn, convolutional nn dropout, looks into model building techniques, and more. While I am familiarizing myself with TF by following this tutorial and some additional resources, I will be additionally performing exploratory data analysis on the datasets we are using to gain further contextual insight and intuition into the code and the resulting output. Overall, the value that my individual work on this project brings is an "encyclopedia-like" resource for myself or others to reference back to for using TensorFlow. My code is well commented and organized for easy reference. The data exploration will provide clear visuals and explainations about the context and meanings of the results of performing deep learning with TensorFlow.
